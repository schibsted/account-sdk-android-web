/**
 * Task implementation that tries to run the given operation only once when called concurrently.
 *
 * How it works:
 *  1. A thread calling `run` will first check if the operation is already in progress.
 *  2. If it is not, the thread will mark the task as in progress and grab a lock before
 *     running the operation.
 *  3. A subsequent thread calling `run` will see the operation is already in progress and then
 *     block while waiting for the lock to be released.
 *  4. If waiting for the lock times out, the thread will repeat the operation to get a result.
